# TOP-Etch-a-Sketch
Etch-a-Sketch project for TOP foundations section
Some comments in the code are for myself as this is still a learning project, and I want to note important things I learned in code. because of this code may not be ideal.

Fure plans/ideas maybe:

-Add toggle for user to decide if they want color to change only once on mouse hover, or if they would want it to be on every hover?
-Color selector (solid, random, black and white, etc.)
-Better header/buttons/style overall
